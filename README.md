# About me
Hello, my name is Jake, I'm a computer science student from Britain with a deep passion for coding and gaming, finding joy in the seamless fusion of the two. My love for coding dates back to the early days of using a computer, and I thrive on challenges that push the boundaries of my coding skills. Whether it's unraveling complex algorithms or immersing myself in the gaming world, I relish every opportunity to explore the vast possibilities that technology and programming have to offer.
